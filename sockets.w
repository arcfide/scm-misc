(@l "This is a socket library for Chez Scheme which attempts to remain 
as faithful as possible to BSD sockets while still maintaining a 
normal operation that will be familiar to Scheme programmers.
Procedures are documented inline at the top of their main
definitions. 

The current implementation uses records instead of magic numbers. 
Hopefully this keeps the system a little more portable.
Only Internet and Local/Unix domain sockets are supported 
by this code, though additional types should be relatively easy 
to make.

The code itself is organized into 
new socket datatypes and procedures. 
Each relevant chapter discusses these parts in particular detail.
The constants section describes how to extend the constants 
defined for socket procedures.

The library also includes a C Stub and FFI interface to enable the 
low-level data manipulations and system calls when necessary. 

A build script also accompanies the library to help in the building of 
the code on some platforms. It is only meant as a guide, and may not 
work completely on your system."

"When passing socket addresses to foreign procedures, 
we must first convert these Scheme datatypes to a proper foreign socket 
address structure.
To do this, every child of the |socket-address| type 
must provide a converter. 
This should be defined by default, and it should not be necessary 
for the user to specify the converter.
The converter should accept the socket address type 
for which it is defined as its sole argument. 
It should then return a bytevector that represents the 
foreign structure. 

Internally, when we need to communicate with a foreign 
procedure that expects a socket address, we use the following 
wrapper |socket-address->foreign| and if we need to convert an unknown
address type into a Scheme data structure, we use
|foreign->socket-address|.

When constructing a bytevector container for foreign code, 
it is useful to know the size a structure should be before 
creating it. This is defined as |foreign-address-size|, 
but it is defined as part of the record definition for 
socket domains below."

socket in the first return value, and a proper address record in the
second. If, however, the listening socket is set to non-blocking, then
accept will return immediately even if there is no existing connection.
If |accept-socket| returns without having a connection to hand over, the
first return value will be false, and the second will be a condition
record indicating the type of error that was returned, such as the
EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK error conditions. This will give you some more

(@* "Receiving over Sockets"
"Like sending, we want to be able to receive over sockets directly. We
define |receive-from-socket| to correspond roughly to the |recvfrom(2)|
system call. 

\\medskip\\verbatim
(receive-from-socket socket count [flag ...]) => data address
|endverbatim
\\medskip

\\noindent |receive-from-socket| takes a socket, the number of bytes to
receive, and a possibly zero set of flags. Each flag should be a
|receive-from-option| flag. We define a minimal set of these flags
below. The procedure returns a bytevector with the data and the address
of the sender. Note that you cannot assume that the bytevector is the
length of |count| because it is possible that fewer than |count| bytes
may have been received.

If the socket passed to |receive-from-socket| is non-blocking, and there
is no input to be read at the moment, then the data value returned will
be false, and the |address| value will actually be a condition
indicating the type of return error (EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK) that was
returned from the |recvfrom(2)| system call. In the case of a real
error, then the condition will not be returned in this manner, but
raised and signalled.

{\\it Implementation Note:} Right now the function defined below uses
multiple bytevector copies; it would be much better to reduce the number
of copies that are performed. I have done no formal performance testing
of the effects of these copies, however."
