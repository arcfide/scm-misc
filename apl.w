(@l "Anyone who uses Scheme will no doubt question whether or not APL and
Scheme go together at all. Indeed, I wondered this myself. However,
I have always had a strange, almost uncontrollabe fascination with APL,
and while this has, at times, almost compelled me to actually use it, the
overall, longstanding attachment and familiarity with Scheme has prevented
me from making such leaps. Indeed, APL as a language lacks a number of
features that I have come to rely on, including syntactic abstraction.
However, despite my best efforts, I have not been able to escape APL.
Thus, it occured to me that rather than fighting it, I should just give in.
Scheme lacks good multipurpose, 
portable array libraries that can form an useful base for other work.
Why not start with APL?
Sure, it's a little strange, but it's no stranger than the mathematical notation 
that we spend every day working with.

And so, I present to the reader a library for Scheme 
whose purpose is to bring APL to Schemers.
I intend to take liberties where liberties make sense,
and to try to provide as much as I can of APL to the Scheme audience.
Good luck."

To this end, I'm doing a slight tweak on the standard |assert| syntax.
It will work just like a regular |assert| whenever the optimization level 
is less than 3. But whenever it is of level three or higher, 
then the |assert| will be a no-op."

(@* "The APL Datatype"
"APL is actually a dynamic language without many datatypes.
The basic number is supported, as well as strings of characters,
which work like vectors of characters,
and then the array type. That's the most interesting. 
Basically, You can think of a single number as a zero-dimensional array, 
a string as a one dimensional array of characters,
and everything else are just various dimensions of arrays.
The important thing is to design a datatype 
that will have good properties for the type of data processing APL does.
We need to have a representation that let's us reshape and work with the 
arrays without having to do a lot of manipulation. 
I would also like something that is fairly cache friendly.
Right now, my simple and ``good enough'' solution is to have one vector
that talks about the dimensions of the array, and another that stores the elements.

In Chez Scheme, the largest possible vector that you can create is a vector 
of size |(most-positive-fixnum)|. 
This is way bigger on my 64-bit machine than I could hope to address,
so I am not going to worry about handling anything larger than that.
I assume that my arrays will contain fixnum vectors for their dimensions,
and regular vectors for their contents.
Later on, it may be possible to optimize this, but I think that using this generic 
vector datatype for the moment will work fine.
The following table summarizes the APL array structures.

$$\\vbox{
  \\offinterlineskip
  \\halign{
    \\strut # & # & # \\cr
    {\\bf Rank} & {\\bf Name of Array} & {\\bf Description} \\cr
    \\noalign{\\hrule}
    0 & Scalar & One item arranged along no axes. \\cr
    1 & Vector & Zero or more items arranged along one axis. \\cr
    2 & Matix & Zero or more items arranged along two axes. \\cr
    3 & --- & Zero or more items arranged along $n$ axes. \\cr
    \\noalign{\\hrule}
  }
}$$

\\noindent
When we want to deal with these, we want to be able to talk about them 
all as being APL values, without having to worry about Scheme 
structures that look very similar. 
Thus, I have the core |apl-value| type which holds them all.
It has two fields: one to hold the rank, dimensions and the like 
in the form of the aforementioned |fxvector| and the other to 
hold the data object that contains the values."

(@* "Converting Scheme values to APL values"
"I would like to define some sort of correspondence between APL values
and native Scheme values. 
Later, such a correspondence may enable me to treat certain types of
values more efficiently, but my current motivation for doing this is
to help with conversion. 
APL functions might be written to handle any arbitrary Scheme values,
but I hesitate to do this because it complicates the functions.
Instead, I propose an explicit converter that an user must use to
cast native Scheme values into ther appropriate APL equivalents.
 
\\medskip\\verbatim
(->apl-value v)
|endverbatim
\\medskip
 
\\noindent
The procedure |->apl-value| should take any value and produce some
valid |apl-value|. 
It should raise an error if it cannot convert the value.
The following details the conversions.

$$\\vbox{

the native Scheme values; they are not much use to us otherwise."

burden him with the responsibility of determining what sort of value

Instead, we should build up a |case| like dispatch system for the APL
datatype.
 
To begin, the more primitive concepts of type predicates and accessors

(@* "Dealing with Iteration over two arrays"
"Throughout APL there are functions that work as binary operators on
two arrays.  They often have simple degenerate cases where one of the
arrays is a scalar or a single dimensional array.  Scheme has ways of
dealing with the scalar and single dimensional elements of these
iterations.  Things like Scheme vectors provide procedures like
|vector-map| and strings have the non-standard but common
|string-map|.  When we encounter these special cases, it's fairly easy
to iterate over them.  The more complicated cases come when we are
trying to iterate over our apl arrays.  If we need to iterate over
such arrays more work needs to be done.

When iterating over two arrays, we use the following basic algorithm:

\\medskip\\orderedlist
\\li Verify that the shapes of the two arrays are compatible.
\\li Determine the accessors for the elements of the array.
\\li Determine the range of the iteration.
\\li Iterate.
\\endorderedlist
\\medskip

\\noindent
During the verification step, we need to determine whether the two
arrays are of the same general shape.  This basically means comparing
their dimension vectors.  In the simple, degenerate cases like strings
or vectors, we can do something a little easier.

Accessors are a bit of a funny thing here.  This is where the root of
our current techinque rests.  While any array may have any shape, the
ordinary representation that we use intenerally to store the elements
of the array is just a straight up vector.  This let's us avoid some
of the complicated array arithmetic that often comes with doing these
sorts of operations.  APL let's us get away with this because
functions work element-wise through the arrays.  Because of this, so
long as we have an array bounds to work with, we can treat all of our
iterations as a one-dimensional iteration over a vector.  Thus, our
accessors should be binary procedures which work in the same way that
|vector-ref| works.

Since the contents of an apl array (i.e.  --- the internal
representation) may not match the number of elements required exactly,
we should make sure that we know how to loop over these things.  There
are two approaches to take here.  We could require that the accessors
handle that for us, or we could do our own handling of the wrap around
in this library.  I don't think it really matters which way we go.

This leads to the following general implementation.  We capture the
following bindings:

\\itemitem{$f$} $a\\ b\\to c$.  Our operation that we perform on each
element of the arrays.  The iteration will call $f$ on each pair of
elements $a$ and $b$ in the array.

\\itemitem{$a$ \\& $b$} These are our arrays in their encapsulated form.

\\itemitem{$*-shape$} These are our shape procedure which take an
array and give its shape.  The shape should either be a number, when
the array is a vector, or a fixnum vector of the dimensions.

\\itemitem{$*-vec$} These procedures should take the array and give
back the vector suitable for use in the following vector procedures.

\\itemitem{$*-ref$} These procedures work like |vector-ref| and take
the array and an index.  They should return the element in that array
at that index.

\\itemitem{$*-len$} These procedures should return the length of the
vector they are passed.  They operate on the results returned from the
$*-vec$ pair of procedures.

\\noindent
Right now I am using |fxmod| to do the looping around of the vectors.
that way, we loop through the actual vector we have, and this gives us
the right behavior for the APL array looping.  That is, where we may
have a vector which contains fewer elements in the real vector than
our dimensions indicate.  On the other hand, I do not know if any of
these things are optimal, and my guess is that they are not."
