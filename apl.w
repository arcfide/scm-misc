(@l "Anyone who uses Scheme will no doubt question whether or not APL and
Scheme go together at all. Indeed, I wondered this myself. However,
I have always had a strange, almost uncontrollabe fascination with APL,
and while this has, at times, almost compelled me to actually use it, the
overall, longstanding attachment and familiarity with Scheme has prevented
me from making such leaps. Indeed, APL as a language lacks a number of
features that I have come to rely on, including syntactic abstraction.
However, despite my best efforts, I have not been able to escape APL.
Thus, it occured to me that rather than fighting it, I should just give in.
Scheme lacks good multipurpose,
portable array libraries that can form an useful base for other work.
Why not start with APL?
Sure, it's a little strange,
but it's no stranger than the mathematical notation
that we spend every day working with.

And so, I present to the reader a library for Scheme
whose purpose is to bring APL to Schemers.
I intend to take liberties where liberties make sense,
and to try to provide as much as I can of APL to the Scheme audience.
Good luck."

To this end, I'm doing a slight tweak on the standard |assert| syntax.

is less than 3. But whenever it is of level three or higher,
then the |assert| will be a no-op."

))

(@* "The APL Datatype"
"APL is actually a dynamic language without many datatypes.
The basic number is supported, as well as strings of characters,
which work like vectors of characters,
and then the array type. That's the most interesting.
Basically, You can think of a single number as a zero-dimensional array,
a string as a one dimensional array of characters,
and everything else are just various dimensions of arrays.
The important thing is to design a datatype
that will have good properties for the type of data processing APL does.
We need to have a representation that let's us reshape and work with the
arrays without having to do a lot of manipulation.
I would also like something that is fairly cache friendly.
Right now, my simple and ``good enough'' solution is to have one vector
that talks about the dimensions of the array, and another that stores the elements.

In Chez Scheme, the largest possible vector that you can create is a vector
of size |(most-positive-fixnum)|.
This is way bigger on my 64-bit machine than I could hope to address,
so I am not going to worry about handling anything larger than that.
I assume that my arrays will contain fixnum vectors for their dimensions,
and regular vectors for their contents.
Later on, it may be possible to optimize this, but I think that using this generic
vector datatype for the moment will work fine.
The following table summarizes the APL array structures.

$$\\vbox{
  \\offinterlineskip
  \\halign{
    \\strut # & # & # \\cr
    {\\bf Rank} & {\\bf Name of Array} & {\\bf Description} \\cr
    \\noalign{\\hrule}
    0 & Scalar & One item arranged along no axes. \\cr
    1 & Vector & Zero or more items arranged along one axis. \\cr
    2 & Matix & Zero or more items arranged along two axes. \\cr
    3 & --- & Zero or more items arranged along $n$ axes. \\cr
    \\noalign{\\hrule}
  }
}$$

\\noindent
When we want to deal with these, we want to be able to talk about them
all as being APL values, without having to worry about Scheme
structures that look very similar.
Thus, I have the core |apl-value| type which holds them all.
It has two fields: one to hold the rank, dimensions and the like
in the form of the aforementioned |fxvector| and the other to
hold the data object that contains the values."

(@* "Converting Scheme values to APL values"
"I would like to define some sort of correspondence between APL values
and native Scheme values.
Later, such a correspondence may enable me to treat certain types of
values more efficiently, but my current motivation for doing this is
to help with conversion.
APL functions might be written to handle any arbitrary Scheme values,
but I hesitate to do this because it complicates the functions.
Instead, I propose an explicit converter that an user must use to
cast native Scheme values into ther appropriate APL equivalents.

\\medskip\\verbatim
(->apl-value v)
|endverbatim
\\medskip

\\noindent
The procedure |->apl-value| should take any value and produce some
valid |apl-value|.
It should raise an error if it cannot convert the value.
The following details the conversions.

$$\\vbox{

the native Scheme values; they are not much use to us otherwise."

"The most complex transformation in |->apl-value| by far concerns the
handling of vectors.
If we always assumed that a vector was a single dimensional APL
vector, we would be fine.
However, I would rather catch the situation where we have nested
vectors of the same shape that form matrices or the like.
To that end, assuming that we have already verified that we have
received a vector and that this vector has had all of its elements
converted with |->apl-value|, we want to check to see just how close
to an $n$-dimensional APL array we can make the vector.

Namely, the programmer should not be burdened with whether or not the

He should not be burdened with the array arrithmetic, nor should we
burden him with the responsibility of determining what sort of value
he has.
Instead, we should build up a |case| like dispatch system for the APL
datatype.

To begin, the more primitive concepts of type predicates and accessors
should be defined.
I will make two distinctions between APL values:
we have either arrays or we have scalars.
Scalars may be numbers or characters, and arrays may have one or more
