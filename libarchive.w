Libarchive provides a convenient API for reading and writing of
stream-oriented archive formats.

The best source of documentation for the libarchive functions is the man

(@* 2 "Generic archive structures"
"There are two main generic archive structures for libarchive, archive
structs and archive entry structs. In the archive record, we have a
special field for objects that we lock in the process of working with
the archive. When the archive is no longer needed, we can unlock these
objects.

The archive entry structure is defined in its own section."

(@* "Reading Archives"
"To read a given archive, the general process goes something like this:

\\orderedlist
\\li Open a new archive object.
\\li Set/configure its options
\\li Open the archive
\\li Iterate over the archive entries, 
\\li Possibly read data at the various entries.
\\li Close the archive
\\endorderedlist

\\noindent The Scheme equivalent should work just like this, except that
this should work a little like ports in that an archive should be closed
automatically if the archive object is collected. Otherwise, we can
explicitly finish the object.")

(@* 2 "Opening an archive for reading"
"Opening an archive object is accomplished by the |archive_read_new()|
foreign function. It returns a pointer to an opaque |struct archive|
structure:

\\noindent We want to wrap this function into a function that has a
signature more like this:

\\medskip\\verbatim
(make-archive-read) => archive-object
|endverbatim
\\medskip

\\noindent The |archive-object| should be its own disjoint record type,
and it should have a single field that contains the pointer value.

We also want to make sure that the allocated pointers are cleaned up
after they are run, so we want to create a collection handler that is run
when appropriate."

we want to support for this archive stream. There are a number of these
different formats.

\\li gzip
\\li lzma
\\li none

\\li empty
\\li iso9660

syntax then, which looks like this:

Scheme does not have these same paradigms, we will define more
Scheme-like paradigms below.

The easiest one is the filename, which is basically the same as
|archive_read_open_filename()|. 

\\medskip\\verbatim
(archive-read-open-filename archive path block-size)

corresponds in Scheme to dealing with bytevectors, so we wrap this

various data elements if that is important.

\\medskip\\verbatim

|endverbatim

\\noindent This will open the archive specified using the bytevector
given. Because we need to have a constant and reliable space, we have to
remember to lock the object and add it to the archives set of
associated locked objects."

(@* 2 "Iterating over headers"
"Generally, when dealing with a stream, you will iterate over the
headers, inspecting the information until you find one that has data
that you want. You can then use the data procedures documented below to
extract this information out. Otherwise, if you don't care about the
entry, you will move on to the next entry. The libarchive API does this
with the following procedures:

\\medskip\\verbatim
int archive_read_next_header(struct archive *, struct archive_entry **);
int archive_read_next_header2(struct archive *, struct archive_entry *);
|endverbatim
\\medskip

\\noindent The first version just makes available an entry from an
already existing internal entry. The second actually populates an entry
that you give it. We don't have much need for the first, since we aren't
trying to avoid allocation here. It would be nice to have an interface
like this:

\\medskip\\verbatim
(archive-read-next-header archive) => archive-entry
|endverbatim
\\medskip

\\noindent Obviously we don't want these headers to suddenly change.
This makes the only reasonable interface one where we control and
allocate a new archive entry every time we call the function. For this
reason we will ignore the first function."

(@c
(define archive-read-next-header 
  (let ([next (foreign-procedure "archive_read_next_header2"
                (uptr uptr) int)])
    (lambda (arc)

        (unless ptr 
          (error 'archive-read-next-header 
            "archive already finished" arc))
        (let* ([entry (make-archive-entry)]
               [entry-ptr (archive-entry-ptr entry)])
          (let ([res (next ptr entry-ptr)])
            (if (zero? res)
                entry
                (archive-error 'archive-read-next-header arc))))))))
))

(@* 2 "Reading data out of archive entries"
"Even though we may have information inside the headers about a given
entry in our archive, this doesn't contain the actual data of the entry.
If we want to do this, we need to actually call some read functions that
the API defines. The libarchive provides the following non-deprecated
procedures for this task:

\\medskip\\verbatim
ssize_t archive_read_data(struct archive *, void *buff, size_t len);
int 
archive_read_data_block(
    struct archive *, const void **buff, size_t *len, off_t *offset);
int archive_read_data_skip(struct archive *);
int archive_read_data_into_fd(struct archive *, int fd);
|endverbatim
\\medskip

\\noindent The |archive_read_data()| procedure only seems useful to me
if you want to specify the buffer size yourself, but we're sort of doing
this with our own block size anyways. Moreover, you can't handle sparse
files correctly with this procedure, so I'd prefer to just avoid using
it entirely, and instead focus on using the more general
|archive_read_data_block()| procedure, which actually avoids copying
data (we'll have to do some of that anyways) and can correctly handle
sparse files. The skip procedure allows us to skip all of the data in a
given entry. I haven't figured out why it is important, actually.

The |archive_read_data_into_fd()| procedure is basically a way to write
and entire archive entry into a file descriptor, which corresponds
nicely to the Scheme idea of writing to an output port. We'll want to
make sure that this works mostly the same way, but we'll need to
implement it natively in Scheme because we have no way to convert output
ports into file descriptors.

Anyways, on to the main and primarily useful function.

\\medskip\\verbatim
(archive-read-data-block archive) => bytevector offset
|endverbatim
\\medskip

\\noindent The |archive-read-data-block| procedure gives us back a
bytevector containing the data of the entry starting at the given
offset. Repeated calls to this procedure will give us the next blocks
each time. The same guarantees as |archive_read_data_block()| apply, in
that each block will not overlap with the last, and that each offset
will increase.

I've read the last block."

While we might use protocols for this, we don't, because we also want to

was obtained using other procedures, such as |archive_entry_clone()|.
Instead, we use protocols to ensure that the object is registered with
