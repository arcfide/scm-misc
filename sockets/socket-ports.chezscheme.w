(@l "Normal socket operations [[send-to-socket]] and
[[receive-from-socket]] are not generally useful when dealing with
connected sockets that will have simple textual data.  Instead, it is
more useful to convert these to ports.  The following library provides
Chez Scheme specific features for converting a socket into a port."

(arcfide sockets socket-ports)
(export socket->port socket->input-port socket->output-port)
(import 
	(rnrs base) 
	(arcfide sockets)
	(only (chezscheme) 
		open-fd-input-port 
		open-fd-output-port
		open-fd-input/output-port))

(@* "Implementation"
"Chez Scheme already provides most of the features necessary, so the actual incantation is 
quite simple.

\\medskip\\verbatim
(socket->port socket b-mode transcoder)
|endverbatim
\\medskip

\\noindent 
|socket->port| returns two values, an input port and an
output port.  The |b-mode| and |transcoder| correspond to
their R6RS interpretations for port creators.  There are also
analagous |socket->input-port| and |socket->output-port|
operations, which may be used if separate |b-mode| and
|transcoder| values should be used for the input and output ports."

(@c
(define (socket->port sock . args)
  (let ([fd (socket-fd sock)])
    (let ([port (apply open-fd-input/output-port (cons fd args))])
      (values port port))))

(define (socket->input-port sock . args)
	(apply open-fd-input-port (cons (socket-fd sock) args)))

(define (socket->output-port sock . args)
	(apply open-fd-output-port (cons (socket-fd sock) args)))
