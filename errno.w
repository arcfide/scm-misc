(@l "This library provides a Chez Scheme specific means for getting the
current errno value.  It also provides some safety conveniences for
doing so, to ensure that the |errno| value  does not accidently change
in the midst of the call.

This is a Chez Scheme specific library, and it is expected that other systems should have 
their own way of accomplishing this."
