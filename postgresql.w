(@l "This library defines a pure Scheme PostgreSQL driver supporting 
the PostgreSQL Message protocol version 3.0. This protocol is supported 
by all versions of PostgreSQL 7.4 and later. It is a pure Scheme driver, 
meaning that it does not depend or interface with any foreign libraries 
for its operation. It is written in a fairly Schemely style and will 
hopefully support the full range of the protocol."

(@* "Roadmap"
"Currently, the following stages are planned in the development of this 
library.

\\orderedlist
\\li Simple Startup protocol and handshake support
\\li Connection Termination
\\li Simple query support
\\li Request Cancellation
\\li Extended Query support
\\li Copy operations
\\li Streaming Replication
\\endorderedlist

\\noindent
Importantly, note that I do not intend to support the deprecated 
function call operations that are supported by the protocol. As 
documented in the PostgreSQL manual, new code should not use these 
operations, and should instead use the aggregate function syntax 
of SQL.")
 
(@* "Loading this library"
"This library relies on the |(arcfide sockets)| library, which has
some foreign library dependencies. Before attempting to load this
library, you should make sure that your application loads the correct
libraries. As of the time of this writing this should be done with the
following:
 
\\medskip\\verbatim
(load-shared-object \"libc.so.6\")
(load-shared-object \"sockets.so.1\")
(load-shared-object \"chez_errno.so.1\")
|endverbatim
\\medskip

\\noindent
The above are for Linux machines. You may have a different set of
libraries for Windows or Mac OS X boxes.")

unnamed portal).
\\itemitem{String}
The name of the source prepared statement (an empty string selects the
unnamed prepared statement).
\\itemitem{Int16}
The number of parameter format codes that follow (denoted $C$ below).
This can be zero to indicate that there are no parameters or that the
parameters all use the default format (text); or one, in which case th
e specified format code is applied to all parameters; or it can equal
the actual number of parameters.
\\itemitem{Int16[$c$]}
The parameter format codes. Each must presently be zero (text) or one
(binary).
\\itemitem{Int16}
The number of parameter values that follow (possibly zero). This must
match the number of parameters needed by the query.
\\medskip
\\noindent
The following are the formats of each pair of fields that appear for
each parameter.
\\medskip
\\itemitem{Int32}
The length of the parameter value, in bytes (this count does not
include itself). Can be zero. As a special case, -1 indicates a NULL
parameter value. No value bytes follow in the NULL case.
\\itemitem{Byte$n$}
The value of the parameter, in the format indicated by the associated
format code. $n$ is the above length.
\\medskip
\\noindent
Once that is done, there are two more fields that appear at the end,
after all of the parameters are listed.
\\medskip
\\itemitem{Int16}
The number of result-column format codes that follow (denoted $R$
below). This can be zero to indicate that there are no result columns
or that the result columns should all use the default format (text);
or one, in which case the specified format code is applied to all
result columns (if any); or it can equal the actual number of result
columns of the query.
\\itemitem{Int16[$R$]}
The result-column format codes. Each must presently be zero (text) or
one (binary).
\\medskip
 
\\noindent
In the actual record layout, we do not store the lengths of any of the
arrays, but instead, this is implicit in the arrays themselves. Thus,
the above fields, which are in the message format, are broken into the
following fields in the record:

\\medskip
\\itemitem{String}
The name of the destination portal as a Scheme string.
\\itemitem{String}
The name of the source prepared statement, as a Scheme string.
\\itemitem{Vector}
The parameter format codes in a vector.
\\itemitem{Vector}
The parameter array as a vector of bytevectors.
\\itemitem{Vector}
The result-column codes in a vector.
\\medskip
 
\\noindent
Since this is a frontend object, we do not have to worry about writing
the reader code for it, since we will never have to read this thing
in. That's a good thing, because it would be annoying to write code
for that. The main work of this message is in the writer, which has to
make sure that all of the proper fields and sizes are written out when
they should be."

to the server and then waiting for an appropriate response. 
I will describe the handling of responses and listening to the server
later, but for now, let's talk about how a connection is initiated and
what happens at that point. 
 
This library defines a connection procedure which takes in a set of
parameter values for the connection request, and sends them off in a
startup message. The procedure itself has the following signature.
 
\\medskip\\verbatim
(postgresql-connect . params)
|endverbatim
 
\\medskip\\noindent
The procedure returns one value, and the |params| are
expected to be an association list mapping symbol keys to their values
in suitable fashion. The user is welcome to throw in any parameters
that he wants, but the following are specifically supported and used:
 
\\medskip
\\itemitem{server} A string representing the server address, it
defaults to ``localhost.''
\\itemitem{port} A number indicating the port, by default this is
5432. 
\\itemitem{user} (Mandatory) This field indicates the user for the
database.
\\itemitem{database} A string containing the name of the database. it
defaults to the username.
\\itemitem{password} A string that contains the password for
authentication. 
\\itemitem{server-parameters} An association list containing the run-time
parameters that the user wishes to set. [XXX: Currently not
implemented.]
\\medskip
 
\\noindent 
The startup message takes a list of parameters. To send the startup
message, we need to construct this message from the above received
parameters, but only after we have converted them to the appropriate
form and stripped out anything that we don't want. We use the other
parameters to create the connection. We return a

When the client receives an authentication request that it cannot

process a series of messages, such as backend key, notice, parameter
