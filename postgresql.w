(@* "Version 8.0 Workaround"
"There is currently a bug in version 8.0 of Chez Scheme that
causes some problems with the following library. To fix this, we run
the following code as a workaround."
 
(@c
(#%$sremprop 'r6rs:record-constructor 'cp02)
))

(@l "This library defines a pure Scheme PostgreSQL driver supporting 
the PostgreSQL Message protocol version 3.0. This protocol is supported 
by all versions of PostgreSQL 7.4 and later. It is a pure Scheme driver, 
meaning that it does not depend or interface with any foreign libraries 
for its operation. It is written in a fairly Schemely style and will 
hopefully support the full range of the protocol."

"Currently, the following stages are planned in the development of this 
library.

\\orderedlist
\\li Simple Startup protocol and handshake support
\\li Connection Termination
\\li Simple query support
\\li Request Cancellation
\\li Extended Query support
\\li Copy operations
\\li Streaming Replication
\\endorderedlist

\\noindent
Importantly, note that I do not intend to support the deprecated 
function call operations that are supported by the protocol. As 
documented in the PostgreSQL manual, new code should not use these 
operations, and should instead use the aggregate function syntax 
of SQL.")
 
(@* "Loading this library"
"This library relies on the |(arcfide sockets)| library, which has
some foreign library dependencies. Before attempting to load this
library, you should make sure that your application loads the correct
libraries. As of the time of this writing this should be done with the
following:
 
\\medskip\\verbatim
(load-shared-object \"libc.so.6\")
(load-shared-object \"sockets.so.1\")
(load-shared-object \"chez_errno.so.1\")
|endverbatim

The above are for Linux machines. You may have a different set of
libraries for Windows or Mac OS X boxes.")

The name of the destination portal (an empty string selects the
unnamed portal).
\\itemitem{String}
The name of the source prepared statement (an empty string selects the
unnamed prepared statement).
\\itemitem{Int16}
The number of parameter format codes that follow (denoted $C$ below).
This can be zero to indicate that there are no parameters or that the
parameters all use the default format (text); or one, in which case th
e specified format code is applied to all parameters; or it can equal
the actual number of parameters.
\\itemitem{Int16[$c$]}
The parameter format codes. Each must presently be zero (text) or one
(binary).
\\itemitem{Int16}
The number of parameter values that follow (possibly zero). This must
match the number of parameters needed by the query.
\\medskip
\\noindent
The following are the formats of each pair of fields that appear for
each parameter.
\\medskip
\\itemitem{Int32}
The length of the parameter value, in bytes (this count does not
include itself). Can be zero. As a special case, -1 indicates a NULL
parameter value. No value bytes follow in the NULL case.
\\itemitem{Byte$n$}
The value of the parameter, in the format indicated by the associated
format code. $n$ is the above length.
\\medskip
\\noindent
Once that is done, there are two more fields that appear at the end,
after all of the parameters are listed.
\\medskip
\\itemitem{Int16}
The number of result-column format codes that follow (denoted $R$
below). This can be zero to indicate that there are no result columns
or that the result columns should all use the default format (text);
or one, in which case the specified format code is applied to all
result columns (if any); or it can equal the actual number of result
columns of the query.
\\itemitem{Int16[$R$]}
The result-column format codes. Each must presently be zero (text) or
one (binary).
\\medskip
 
\\noindent
In the actual record layout, we do not store the lengths of any of the
arrays, but instead, this is implicit in the arrays themselves. Thus,
the above fields, which are in the message format, are broken into the
following fields in the record:

\\medskip
\\itemitem{String}
The name of the destination portal as a Scheme string.
\\itemitem{String}
The name of the source prepared statement, as a Scheme string.
\\itemitem{Vector}
The parameter format codes in a vector.
\\itemitem{Vector}
The parameter array as a vector of bytevectors.
\\itemitem{Vector}
The result-column codes in a vector.
\\medskip
 
\\noindent
Since this is a frontend object, we do not have to worry about writing
the reader code for it, since we will never have to read this thing
in. That's a good thing, because it would be annoying to write code
for that. The main work of this message is in the writer, which has to

startup message. The procedure itself has the following signature.
 
\\medskip\\verbatim
(postgresql-connect . params)

The procedure returns one value, and the |params| are
expected to be an association list mapping symbol keys to their values

that he wants, but the following are specifically supported and used:

\\itemitem{server} A string representing the server address, it
defaults to ``localhost.''
\\itemitem{port} A number indicating the port, by default this is
5432. 
\\itemitem{user} (Mandatory) This field indicates the user for the
database.
\\itemitem{database} A string containing the name of the database. it
defaults to the username.
\\itemitem{password} A string that contains the password for
authentication. 
\\itemitem{server-parameters} An association list containing the run-time
parameters that the user wishes to set. [XXX: Currently not

\\medskip

message, we need to construct this message from the above received

(@ "Once the startup message has been sent, we have to deal with a
number of various responses that the server could send back to us.
Either it
will require authentication or the client may be given a final
response to authentication immediately.
The final responses are one of two messages:
 
\\unorderedlist
\\li An Authentication Okay message,
\\li or, an Error Response message.
\\endunorderedlist
 
\\noindent
These messages will indicate whether the client can continue. If the
client receives the error message, the connection will have been
closed by the server.
 
The server may request that authentication be performed. There are a
number of authentication messages:
 
\\unorderedlist
\\li Kerberos V5 
\\li Clear text
\\li MD5
\\li SCM Credential
\\li GSS
\\li SSPI
\\li GSS Continue
\\endunorderedlist
 
\\noindent
At the moment, this client only supports clear text, unencrypted
communication. This is dangerous, but expedient. You can wrap the
connection, hopefully in some other SSL protocols, but for the moment,
this is all that we are supporting until we can get some time to do
the others correctly. 
 
When the client receives an authentication request that it cannot
handle, it will immediately close the connection. After an 
authentication okay message has been sent, the client must still
process a series of messages, such as backend key, notice, parameter
status, and error messages. An error response is treated the same
before or after the authentication okay message. The parameter status
and other messages change the connection state in the connection
object. Finally, after these messages are processed, if everything
goes okay, a ready for query message should be sent by the server, in
which case we are all done."

fail with an error.
\\li The server could send us any number of incidental messages, which
we will handle by printing or updating the state of the system
somehow, and then continuing.
\\li We could receive a command complete message before processing any
row data or row description messages, which means that the query was
purely side-effecting and we don't have to return anything.
\\li We could receive some copy in or copy out responses, which are
things that we currently don't support. In this case, we just raise an
error. XXX: This needs to be fixed.
\\li We might encounter the empty query response, which means that the
query which we sent was entirely empty. In this case, we'll want to
raise a continuable error indicating that this was the case and let
them go on their merry way.

messages. This means that we have only one result. In this case, we
