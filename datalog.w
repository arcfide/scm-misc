This software is a port of Jay McCarthy's Datalog library for Racket
with modifcations to make it suit the Chez Scheme programming
environment better.  I am currently unable to find the copyrights for
this library online, so I am assuming that I can use the code.
Additions and modifications made by myself fall under the following
